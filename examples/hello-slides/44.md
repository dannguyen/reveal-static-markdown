title: Writing syntax and highlighting it
notes: |
  The syntax highlighting comes from highlight.js, which can be found here: https://highlightjs.org/

  Here are some notes from reveal.js about syntax highlighting: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/#code-syntax-highlighting

Some JavaScript code:

```js
var x = 9, y = "hello";
let q = function(a, b){ console.log(a, b);
  return "done";
};
```
I like code.
